Quick post because I started talking to a friend about this.

ProjectEuler is a website which you can either describe as math problems designed as programming problems, or programming problems designed as math problems.

Either way, it's fun.

The first and most tutorial-ish question is:

> Find the sum of all the multiples of $3$ or $5$ below $1000$.

And another problem with a short problem statement:

> $40755$ is a triangle number that is also pentagonal and hexagonal.
> Find the next.

The best thing about this is each problem has a number for its answer. So you can suffer by waiting 24 hours for your inefficient program to run or try to find something that runs in less than a minute.

Once you get in, ask me for my friend key so that [you can see my progress](https://projecteuler.net/progress=guissmo)'s if you're interested.
